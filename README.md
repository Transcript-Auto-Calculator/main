# CGPA Calculator for McMaster Students

## 📌 Project Objective

The **CGPA Calculator App** is designed for **McMaster University students** using **Flutter**. This app allows students to input their **grades** for courses with varying **unit values** and automatically compute their **Cumulative GPA (CGPA)** based on **McMaster’s unique 12-point grading system**.

## ❓ Why This Project?

McMaster University **does not** provide a cumulative GPA system; instead, it only displays **term-based GPA**. This limitation makes it difficult for students to track their **overall academic performance**. 

This app helps **bridge that gap** by allowing students to calculate both **term-based GPA** and **overall CGPA**. Since GPA plays a crucial role in:
- **Graduate school admissions**
- **Scholarships**
- **Co-op placements**
- **Job recruitment**

Having an accessible and accurate **CGPA tracking** system helps students make better academic and career decisions.
